    "content": "Genshin Impact is a whimsical, wondrous land dripping with unbridled charm and appeal, combining a ridiculously compelling reward loop with unfettered, continuous discovery. In this world I felt like a child visiting theme park for the first time — dazzled, mesmerized, and completely swept away. I only wish the shimmering glow wasn’t marred by a ghoulish monetization model, but that’s something I’m willing to overlook for my ticket to this fascinating realm.",

    "content": "Oh, the joy of exploring this beautiful world. Oh, the clever combat, the great voice acting, the compelling story. This is one of the best RPGs of the year. And it’s almost beyond comprehension that you can get it for free.",

    "content": "Overall, in spite of things that should bring Genshin Impact down, the game is so much fun to play that the negatives are ultimately minor gripes. [...] The gameplay is smooth and simplistic, and it works great on all platforms - though I’m still not sure why the PlayStation version can’t be linked to a Mihoyo account so I could play on my phone when I’m not at home (PS Vita version please??) but it’s a small gripe to an otherwise terrific game.",

    "content": "Genshin Impact is an amazing open-world adventure that draws heavily on both its Breath of the Wild and anime inspirations to create something truly special. Even if the gacha model introduces some undesirable level grinding deeper in, the excellent combat, addictive exploration, and beautiful world make this one of the most exciting games I've played all year.",

    "content": "Obviously, it's not a perfect game, but Genshin Impact deserves a try from RPG fans. There's plenty of in-game content to explore, and while many assumed this was just Breath of the Wild with microtransactions, Genshin Impact has a surprising amount of depth and content for players to enjoy.",

    "content": "Despite its uncanny superficial similarities to a certain popular Nintendo IP, Genshin Impact has enough personality to stand on its own, while also offering a creative combat system and an expansive world to explore.",
